# Understanding the Foucault Pendulum with a Sheet of Paper 

Understanding the rotation of the Foucault Pendulum is easy.
You only need a sheet of paper!

### Cut out the figure along the bold lines

### Then, build it up!

For example, overlay the 0-degree line  on top of the 50-degree line, and fix with a clip.

### Completed !

Rotate the paper model and look at the arrow which comes in front of you.
Or rotate yourself around the model!

### Animation

Rotation at 50 degrees north latitude

### Why?

Obviously the pendulum does not rotate at the North Pole.
It's only the ground that rotates.
The pendulum simply translates in parallel.

In the mid-latitudes, the ground is inclined with respect to the earth's axis.
The pendulum moves on a cone surface consequently.

Surely the pendulum will move in parallel on the cone.
